Running the Game
----------------

As the game is still _very_ much under-development, there is no `.love` package available.
Therefore, in order to run, do the following:

1.	First, install [LÖVE][1] for you system, if you haven't.
2.	From the `yourglass` directory run your system's relevant runner script; eg `run.sh` on Linux.
3.	Et voila, it runs! Impressive eh?
