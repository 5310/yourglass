Yourglass: A Game of Giving
===========================
What? Why? How? Where? Who?


What?
-----

Yourglass is a game of giving for two gentlemen.[^1]

The idea is to excersize your _right to gift_, as throughly as possible.
The **objective** is to **tilt the hourglass**[^2], insistently abuse gravity, and **empty your half of sand**[^3].
As to _how_ you go about doing it-- Ask [here][how].

Good, clean, gentlemanly fun, if there was any.[^4]

[^1]:   Well, not necessarily. "Gentlemen", that is, not "two".
[^2]:   Or _yourglass_, if you will. Certainly not mine.
[^3]:   So to speak...They are not fat, merely robust.
[^4]:   Continued physical well-being of your keyboard is not guaranteed.


Why?
----

One late afternoon in January[^5], my good friend-philosopher-and-guide Joy, in his highness[^6], decided to, in the following order; make an RPG, not make an rpg, make the same rpg in a steampunk fashion, cancel it, make something new, cancel that, make something old instead. In the resulting flurry of activity he had decided to learn how to LÖVE[^7].

Being a true scholar, he learns by action; such dedication. He prompty conjured up a small gamelike activity to test his mettle on. The gem was as follows:

Imagine an hourglass, pure and intricate. In it's duality lie two planets.
These planets -- imagine one to be that of vile-creatures[^8] and the other to be that akin to our Mother-Earth[^9] -- will struggle for influence.
As the Viles rise they shall drop seeds of corruption downwards. As the Earth rises it will bestow cleansing motes to the Viles in turn.
The singular player will have bear the burden of seeing his Earth rise, and overcome the vile opposition -- A _toy_ of allegoric proportions.
The _trick_, if I may so use a word so vulgar, is to make the balance as intricate the glass itself.

(I have taken the liberty of transliterating the above monolog to the best of my abilities.)

As lively as my friend's mind is -- truly a work of ceaseless marvel -- I was skeptical of the idea and the resulting construct's _potentiel pour le plaisir_.
And after few words of forthright encouragement[^10] I forgot all about it. Later that night, my sleep was interrupted with visions of unforseen majesty.
Quickly, shaking aside my slumber, I had put down to paper[^11] an idea quite similar to Joy's own.

Except, it will be a game fit for gentlemen.[^11]

[^5]:   23rd January 2011, to be pedantic.
[^6]:   Think _opium_ instead of _royal-plurals_. Then, think _manic-enthusiasm_.
[^7]:   You cannot _possibly_ suggest a jest wittier than those already uttered. Give up.
[^8]:   He said "_the Zerg_". Believe me.
[^9]:   And likewise, "_a Terran planet_".
[^10]:  "It sucks. But you gotta start somewhere. Do it."
[^11]:  Well, _pixel_. You know how it is.
[^12]:  Which I would enter in the [TIGcompo: Versus][tigcompo] without telling him...


How?
----

The controls are simple enough for even a simpleton to understand.

(keymap image) (insistence example)

The gentleman in **blue** will **tilt the glass by** means of the `left`/`right` buttons.
And to gird his loins in righteous **insistence**, he will **press-and-hold** `down`.[^13]
The gentleman in Red will reflect the same with the `A`/`D` and `S` keys, in that order.

The game has no fixation with a certain rodent.[^14]

[^13]:  Try not to visualize it.
[^14]:  Mice are for cats. Real gentlemen use keyboards. Possibly ones which go _clickety-clack_, like the IBM Model M[^15].
[^15]:  It is not strictly necessary.


Where?
----

Here, of course. Choose your model, packaging is -- as the say -- on-the-house.

*   [Windows without LÖVE.][exe]
*   [For Linux, OSX, and/or Windows with LÖVE!"][love]
*   [LÖVE itself, for all!][love2d]

And, of course, for those rugged, adventerous individuals who wish to see how things work[^16], here's the [source][source] courtesy of the ever-so-helpful [Hub-o'-Gits][github].

[^16]:  Very, very messily. Grab some popcorn and read `main.lua`, your afternoon shall not go mirthless.
[^17]:  Misleadingly titled, yes?


Who?
----

The original idea was sired by the amazing Sir [Joy Bhattacherjee][evermore]. [^18]

And the game and the reimagined gameplay was made by yours truly, [Sayantan Chaudhuri][scio], Esq[^19].

The game was made using the the wonderful framework [LÖVE][love2d].[^20]

And of course, [Github][github]. Without whom there would be no remote-hosting...:sniff: Those brave, self-less souls.

Lest we forget, if it weren't for the ongoing Tigcompo, lack of progress on my main project, and whatever I ate that night, there would have been zergs _in our base_, _eating of our dudes_.[^21]

The dashingly bold typeface used throughout Yourglass is called [Chunkfive][chunkfive], by [The League of Movable Type][movabletype].

'Freeware Game Pick' on [The Indie Games Weblog][igcom]!

All this, except the bits which are already owned by other entities, is licensed under [CC-BY-SA][cc]. A gentleman's license, if there ever was one.[^22]

[^18]:  Yes, 'Joy' truly is a boy's name where we're from. The manliest, in fact. It is a title reserved for the most stalwart of men of a certain status.
[^19]:  I have also added a secret routine to make the Queen always win. _Knighthood, here I cometh!_
[^20]:  Still not Python, darnit.
[^21]:  Probably not. Joy would possibly have decided against the idea and started work on a _genetically-based solitaire_ if I know him.
[^22]:  That means that you can do whatever you want with it, but you'll have to mention we made it first, and you'll have to be just as sharing with it, if not more.[^23]
[^23]:  Simple wasn't it? Why do we have lawyers?[^24]
[^24]:  Doesn't count as legal advice. Just...deal with it, okay?
