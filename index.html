            <p>Yourglass is a game of giving for two gentlemen.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup></p>

            <p>The idea is to excersize your <em>right to gift</em>, as throughly as possible.
            The <strong>objective</strong> is to <strong>tilt the hourglass</strong><sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup>, insistently abuse gravity, and <strong>empty your half of sand</strong><sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" rel="footnote">3</a></sup>.
            As to <em>how</em> you go about doing it— Ask <a href="#how">here</a>.</p>

            <h3>(video)(images)</h3>

            <p>Good, clean, gentlemanly fun.<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" rel="footnote">4</a></sup></p>

        <article id="why">
            <h2>Why?</h2>

            <p>One late afternoon in January<sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5" rel="footnote">5</a></sup>, my good friend-philosopher-and-guide Joy, in his highness<sup id="fnref:6"><a href="#fn:6" rel="footnote">6</a></sup>, decided to, in the following order; make an RPG, not make an rpg, make the same rpg in a steampunk fashion, cancel it, make something new, cancel that, make something old instead. In the resulting flurry of activity he had decided to learn how to LÖVE<sup id="fnref:7"><a href="#fn:7" rel="footnote">7</a></sup>.</p>

            <p>Being a true scholar, he learns by action; such dedication. He prompty conjured up a small gamelike activity to test his mettle on. The gem was as follows:</p>

            <blockquote>Imagine an hourglass, pure and intricate. In it's duality lie two planets.
            These planets — imagine one to be that of vile-creatures<sup id="fnref:8"><a href="#fn:8" rel="footnote">8</a></sup> and the other to be that akin to our Mother-Earth<sup id="fnref:9"><a href="#fn:9" rel="footnote">9</a></sup> — will struggle for influence.
            As the Viles rise they shall drop seeds of corruption downwards. As the Earth rises it will bestow cleansing motes to the Viles in turn.
            The singular player will have bear the burden of seeing his Earth rise, and overcome the vile opposition — A <em>toy</em> of allegoric proportions.
            The <em>trick</em>, if I may so use a word so vulgar, is to make the balance as intricate the glass itself.</blockquote>

            <p>(<em>I have taken the liberty of transliterating the above monolog to the best of my abilities.</em>)</p>

            <p>As lively as my friend's mind is — truly a work of ceaseless marvel — I was skeptical of the idea and the resulting construct's <em>potentiel pour le plaisir</em>.
            And after few words of forthright encouragement<sup id="fnref:10"><a href="#fn:10" rel="footnote">10</a></sup> I forgot all about it. Later that night, my sleep was interrupted with visions of unforseen majesty.
            Quickly, shaking aside my slumber, I had put down to paper<sup id="fnref:11"><a href="#fn:11" rel="footnote">11</a></sup> an idea quite similar to Joy's own.</p>

            <p>Except, it will be a game fit for gentlemen.<sup id="fnref:11"><a href="#fn:11" rel="footnote">11</a></sup></p>
        </article>

        <article id="how">
            <h2>How?</h2>

            <p>The controls are simple enough for even a simpleton to understand.</p>

            <h3>(keymap image) (insistence example)</h3>

            <p>The gentleman in <strong class="blu">blue</strong> will <strong>tilt the glass by</strong> means of the <code class="blu">left</code>/<code class="blu">right</code> buttons.
            And to gird his loins in righteous <strong>insistence</strong>, he will <strong>press-and-hold</strong> <code class="blu">down</code>.<sup id="fnref:13"><a href="#fn:13" rel="footnote">13</a></sup></p>
            <p>The gentleman in <strong class="red">red</strong> will reflect the same with the <code class="red">A</code>/<code class="red">D</code> and <code class="red">S</code> keys, in that order.</p>

            <p>The game has no fixation with a certain rodent.<sup id="fnref:14"><a href="#fn:14" rel="footnote">14</a></sup></p>

        <article id="where">
            <h2>Where?</h2>

            <h2>Who?</h2>

            <p>The original idea was sired by the amazing Sir <a href="mailto:joy.bhattacherjee@gmail.com" class="red">Joy Bhattacherjee</a>. <sup id="fnref:18"><a href="#fn:18" rel="footnote">18</a></sup></p>

            <p>And the game and the reimagined gameplay was made by yours truly, <a href="http://www.google.com/profiles/Sayantan.Chaudhuri" class="blu">Sayantan Chaudhuri</a>, Esq<sup id="fnref:19"><a href="#fn:19" rel="footnote">19</a></sup>.</p>

            <p>The game was made using the wonderful framework <a href="http://love2d.org/">LÖVE</a>.<sup id="fnref:20"><a href="#fn:20" rel="footnote">20</a></sup></p>
            <p>And of course, <a href="https://github.com/">Github</a>. Without whom there would be no remote-hosting...:sniff: Those brave, self-less souls.</p>

            <p>Lest we forget, if it weren't for the ongoing Tigcompo, lack of progress on my main project, and whatever I ate that night, there would have been zergs <em>in our base</em>, <em>eating of our dudes</em>.<sup id="fnref:21"><a href="#fn:21" rel="footnote">21</a></sup></p>
